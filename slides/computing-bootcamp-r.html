# Preliminaries

---

## GitHub account

A couple things to get everyone on the same page

- If you don't have one, sign up for a GitHub account (it takes 1 min.)
    - Go to https://github.com/join
    - Enter your information
    - Pick the `Unlimited public repositories for free.` plan
    
A few suggestions on picking a GitHub username:

- Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with. 
  It makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.

- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.

- Shorter is better than longer.

- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings 
  GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.

- Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or 
  place of residence.

- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming.

---

## Accessing R / RStudio

For today, the preferred method is to use DSS RStudio servers:

- PhD: https://knight.stat.duke.edu:8787/
- MS: https://rook.stat.duke.edu:8787/
- UG: https://pawn.stat.duke.edu:8787/

Log in with your Duke `netid` and password
    
If you cannot access the servers:

- Use R and RStudio on your computer

    - Download R on your computer [here](http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/)
    - Download RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
    
- Use a docker container from Duke OIT

    1. Go to https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers
    2. Log in with your Duke NetID and password
    3. Find `RStudio - statistics application with Rmarkdown and knitr support`
    4. Click the link to create your environment

---

## Today's materials

Everything from today will be available on my GitHub account at
https://github.com/shawnsanto/computing-bootcamp-2019. You'll learn how to
get this on your computer shortly.

# Responsible research and reproducibility

## Seizure study retracted after authors realize data got "terribly mixed"

From the authors of **Low Dose Lidocaine for Refractory Seizures in 
Preterm Neonates**:

*"The article has been retracted at the request of the authors. After 
carefully re-examining the data presented in the article, they identified 
that data of two different hospitals got terribly mixed. The published 
results cannot be reproduced in accordance with scientific and clinical 
correctness."*

---

## Bad spreadsheet merge kills depression paper, quick fix resurrects it

- The authors informed the journal that the merge of lab results and other 
survey data used in the paper resulted in an error regarding the 
identification codes. Results of the analyses were based on the data set 
in which this error occurred. Further analyses established the results 
reported in this manuscript and interpretation of the data are not correct.

- **Original conclusion:** Lower levels of CSF IL-6 were associated with 
current depression and with future depression [...].

- **Revised conclusion:** Higher levels of CSF IL-6 and IL-8 were 
associated with current depression [...].

---

## Study of social media retracted when authors can’t provide data

"*A business journal has retracted a 2016 paper about how social media can encourage young consumers to become devoted to particular brands, after discovering flaws in the data and findings.*"

Reasons for retraction:

- Error in data
- Error in results and/or conclusions
- Results not reproducible

## Heart pulls sodium meta-analysis over duplicated, and now missing, data

"*The journal Heart has retracted a 2012 meta-analysis after learning that two of the six studies included in the review contained duplicated data.  Those studies, it so happens, were conducted by one of the co-authors.*"

From the retraction notice, "*The Committee considered that without sight of the raw data on which the two papers containing the duplicate data were based, their reliability could not be substantiated. Following inquiries, it turns out that the raw data are no longer available having been lost as a result of computer failure.*"

Reasons for retraction:

- Duplication of data
- Results not reproducible

Source: http://retractionwatch.com/2013/05/02/heart-pulls-sodium-meta-analysis-over-duplicated-and-now-missing-data/

---

## Reproducibility: why should we care?

1. Convince researchers to adopt a reproducible research workflow

2. Train new researchers who don’t have any other workflow

---

## Reproducible data analysis

- Scriptability `\(\rightarrow\)` R

- Literate programming `\(\rightarrow\)` R Markdown

- Version control `\(\rightarrow\)` git / GitHub

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Could these tools have prevented some of the aforementioned retractions?

---

## Donald Knuth "Literate Programming (1983)"

"Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: 
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a *computer* what 
to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to *human beings* what we 
want a computer to do."

"The practitioner of literate programming [...] strives for a program that 
is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an order 
that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal and 
informal methods that reinforce each other."

- These ideas have been around for years!
- Tools for putting them to practice have also been around.
- They have never been as accessible as the current tools.

---

## Reproducibility checklist

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done? (e.g., how 
were parameter settings chosen?)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Can the code be used for other data?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Can you extend the code to do other things?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
---

## Ambitious goal

We need an environment where

- data, analysis, and results are tightly connected, or better yet, 
inseparable,

- reproducibility is built in,
    + the original data remains untouched
    + all data manipulations and analyses are inherently documented

- documentation is human readable and syntax is minimal.

---

## Toolkit

![](img/toolkit.png)

---

## What is markdown?

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating HTML (or XHTML) 
documents.

- Markup languages are designed to produce documents from human readable 
text (and annotations).

- Some of you may be familiar with LaTeX. This is another (less human 
friendly) markup language for creating pdf documents.

- Why I love Markdown:
    + Easy to learn and use.
    + Focus on **content**, rather than **coding** and debugging 
    **errors**.
    + Once you have the basics down, you can get fancy and add HTML,
    JavaScript, and CSS.

## Why should I use markdown?

If you have an annoying process for authoring for the web ...

or

If you avoid authoring for the web, because you're not sure how ...

**start writing in Markdown**!

# R / RStudio

---

## R / RStudio

Rather than use the R graphical user interface we will use RStudio. 
RStudio is a free and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for 
R.

For today, the preferred method is to use DSS RStudio servers:

- PhD: https://knight.stat.duke.edu:8787/
- MS: https://rook.stat.duke.edu:8787/
- UG: https://pawn.stat.duke.edu:8787/

Log in with your Duke `netid` and password
    
If you cannot access the servers:

- Use R and RStudio on your computer
    
- Use a docker container from Duke OIT

---


## Getting started today

In order to get started, you need to obtain today's files from GitHub. The
steps below will give you access.

1. Log in to GitHub

2. Navigate to https://github.com/shawnsanto/computing-bootcamp-2019

3. Fork the repository

4. Copy the link under `Clone or Download` to clone with HTTPS

5. In RStudio go to `File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git`

6. Paste the URL, that you copied in step 4, in the box under `Repository URL:`

7. Open file `gapminder.Rmd`

You now should have all the files in the repository in a directory on the
server or your own computer.

---

## R packages

- Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include 
reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, 
and sample data.

- In the following exercises we'll use the **tidyverse** package
    + The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.
    + The core tidyverse package consists of **ggplot2**, **tibble**, **tidyr**, **readr**, **purrr**, **dplyr**, **stringr**, and **forcats** packages.
    
- This package is already installed for you on the server, but elsewhere you can 
install it by running the following in the *Console*:


```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

- You need to load this package with


```r
library(tidyverse)
```

- You only need to install a package once, but you must load it with function
  `library()` each R session.

---

## A note on workspaces

- Your R Markdown document and your Console do not share workspaces.

- This is good for reproducibility, but can sometimes result in frustrating 
errors.

- This also means any packages needed for your analysis need to be loaded in 
your R Markdown document as well.

---

## `gapminder.Rmd`

Read in the data and store it as an object named `gap`.


```r
gap &lt;- read_csv("https://bit.ly/gap_data")
```

Function `read_csv()` is part of package `readr`, which is automatically loaded
from package `tidyverse`. Function `read_csv()` not only reads in the data, but
it ensures object `gap` is a neatly formatted data frame - known as a tibble.

---

## Examine `gap`

Let's look at the first 10 rows of `gap`.


```r
gap %&gt;%
  slice(1:10)
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 6
##    country             continent  year lifeExp       pop gdpPercap
##    &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1 United Kingdom      Europe     1967    71.4  54959000    14143.
##  2 Eritrea             Africa     2007    58.0   4906585      641.
##  3 Trinidad and Tobago Americas   1997    69.5   1138101     8793.
##  4 Taiwan              Asia       2002    77.0  22454239    23235.
##  5 Kuwait              Asia       2007    77.6   2505559    47307.
##  6 Brazil              Americas   1987    65.2 142938076     7807.
##  7 Cameroon            Africa     1957    40.4   5359923     1313.
##  8 Hungary             Europe     1982    69.4  10705535    12546.
##  9 Iceland             Europe     1952    72.5    147962     7268.
## 10 Turkey              Europe     1952    43.6  22235677     1969.

## Exercise 1

Take a glimpse at the data set with function `glimpse()`.


```r
glimpse(gap)
```

```
## Observations: 1,363
## Variables: 6
## $ country   &lt;chr&gt; "United Kingdom", "Eritrea", "Trinidad and Tobago", ...

## $ year      &lt;dbl&gt; 1967, 2007, 1997, 2002, 2007, 1987, 1957, 1982, 1952...
## $ lifeExp   &lt;dbl&gt; 71.360, 58.040, 69.465, 76.990, 77.588, 65.205, 40.4...
## $ pop       &lt;dbl&gt; 54959000, 4906585, 1138101, 22454239, 2505559, 14293...
## $ gdpPercap &lt;dbl&gt; 14142.8509, 641.3695, 8792.5731, 23235.4233, 47306.9...
```

---

## Exercise 1

How many variables and observations are in `gap`? What are the variable types
for the variables in `gap`?

Variable | Type
---------|----------
country  | character
continent| character
year     | double
lifeExp  | double
pop      | double
gdpPercap| double

---

## Exercise 2

### Part 1

Create a plot of life expectancy versus year for the United States.


```r
gap_usa &lt;- gap %&gt;% 
  filter(country == "United States")

ggplot(data = gap_usa, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

## Exercise 2

### Part 1

Create a plot of life expectancy versus year for the United States.

&lt;img src="computing-bootcamp-r_files/figure-html/usa-plot-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Exercise 2

### Part 2

Create a plot of life expectancy verses GDP per Capita for Canada. Set the
color of the points to be red and connect them with a solid black line.

&lt;img src="computing-bootcamp-r_files/figure-html/canada-plot-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---


## Exercise 2

### Part 3

Create a plot of life expectancy versus GDP per Capita based on all countries
in Africa in 1992. Set the color to be purple.

&lt;img src="computing-bootcamp-r_files/figure-html/africa-plot-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Exercise 2

### Part 2

Create a plot of life expectancy verses GDP per Capita for Canada. Set the
color of the points to be red and connect them with a solid black line.


```r
gap_ca &lt;- gap %&gt;% 
  filter(country == "Canada")

ggplot(data = gap_ca, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  geom_line()
```

---

## Exercise 2

### Part 3

Create a plot of life expectancy versus GDP per Capita based on all countries
in Africa in 1992. Set the color to be purple.


```r
gap_africa &lt;- gap %&gt;% 
  filter(continent == "Africa", year == 1992)

ggplot(data = gap_africa, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(color = "purple")
```

---

## Exercise 3

### Part 1

Create a plot of life expectancy versus GDP per Capita based on all the
countries in Africa and Europe in 1992. Set the point colors to code for the
two continents.

*Hints*:

1. Filter `gap` so it only contains observations from Africa or Europe.
   Do this with `continent %in% c("Africa", "Europe")`. Also, filter so that
   the observations are only from 1992. Separate multiple conditions with
   commas.
   
2. Add another aesthetic to the plot. Instead of just `x` and `y`, include
   `color = continent` inside function `aes()`. The color of the points will
   be set for each level of the variable `continent`.

---

## Exercise 3

### Part 2

Create comparison boxplots by continent of GDP per Capita for the year 2007.
Fill the boxplots with color `darkgreen`.

*Hints*:

1. Filter `gap` so it only contains observations from 2007.

2. Inside `aes()` set `x = continent, y = gdpPercap`.

3. Use `geom_boxplot()` and set the fill to `darkgreen`.

---

## Exercise 3

### Part 1


```r
gap_ae &lt;- gap %&gt;% 
  filter(continent %in% c("Africa", "Europe"), year == 1992)

ggplot(data = gap_ae, mapping = aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap,
                                    color = continent)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Part 2


```r
gap_cont &lt;- gap %&gt;% 
  filter(year == 2007)

ggplot(data = gap_cont, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "darkgreen")
```

---

## Reproducible?

- Is your work reproducible?

- Are you able to easily redo your analysis with newly updated data?


```r
gap_upd &lt;- read_csv("https://bit.ly/gap_data_upd")
```

---

## Workflow

Source: Grolemund and Wickham, R for Data Science, http://r4ds.had.co.nz/

---

## Organizing a more complex analysis

- Use folders: raw_data, processed_data, code, figures, etc.

- Number your script files:
    - `00_load_data.R`
    - `01_data_cleanup.R`
    - `02_eda.R`
    - ...

- Use informative names that indicate versioning
    - use dates
    - avoid things like `project_fin`, `project_finalfinal`, etc.

---

## R Markdown suggestions

- Always name your chunks

- Familiarize yourself with chunk options
    - Use global options

- Load packages at the start of a document

- Use `output: github_document` for output viewable on GitHub or


```r
output: 
  html_document: 
    keep_md: yes
```

- Various outputs: Make slides with `output: ioslides_presentation` or `xaringan`,
make websites with `blogdown`, author a book with `bookdown`, etc.
