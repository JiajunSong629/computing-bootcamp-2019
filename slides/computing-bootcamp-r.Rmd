# Preliminaries

---

## GitHub account

A couple things to get everyone on the same page

- If you don't have one, sign up for a GitHub account (it takes 1 min.)
    - Go to https://github.com/join
    - Enter your information
    - Pick the `Unlimited public repositories for free.` plan
    
A few suggestions on picking a GitHub username:

- Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with. 
  Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.

- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.

- Shorter is better than longer.

- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings 
  GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.

- Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or 
  place of residence.

- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming.

## Seizure study retracted after authors realize data got "terribly mixed"

From the authors of **Low Dose Lidocaine for Refractory Seizures in 
Preterm Neonates**:

*"The article has been retracted at the request of the authors. After 
carefully re-examining the data presented in the article, they identified 
that data of two different hospitals got terribly mixed. The published 
results cannot be reproduced in accordance with scientific and clinical 
correctness."*

## Bad spreadsheet merge kills depression paper, quick fix resurrects it

- The authors informed the journal that the merge of lab results and other 
survey data used in the paper resulted in an error regarding the 
identification codes. Results of the analyses were based on the data set 
in which this error occurred. Further analyses established the results 
reported in this manuscript and interpretation of the data are not correct.

- **Original conclusion:** Lower levels of CSF IL-6 were associated with 
current depression and with future depression [...].

- **Revised conclusion:** Higher levels of CSF IL-6 and IL-8 were 
associated with current depression [...].

## Reproducibility: why should we care?

1. Convince researchers to adopt a reproducible research workflow

2. Train new researchers who don’t have any other workflow

---

## Reproducible data analysis

- Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R

- Literate programming $\rightarrow$ R Markdown

- Version control $\rightarrow$ git / GitHub

---

## Donald Knuth "Literate Programming (1983)"

"Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: 
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a *computer* what 
to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to *human beings* what we 
want a computer to do."

"The practitioner of literate programming [...] strives for a program that 
is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an order 
that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal and 
informal methods that reinforce each other."

- These ideas have been around for years!
- and tools for putting them to practice have also been around
- but they have never been as accessible as the current tools

---

## Reproducibility checklist

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done? (e.g., how 
were parameter settings chosen?)
- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

---

## Ambitious goal

We need an environment where

- data, analysis, and results are tightly connected, or better yet, 
inseparable

- reproducibility is built in
    + the original data remains untouched
    + all data manipulations and analyses are inherently documented

- documentation is human readable and syntax is minimal

## What is markdown?

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating HTML (or XHTML) 
documents.

- Markup languages are designed to produce documents from human readable 
text (and annotations).

- Some of you may be familiar with LaTeX. This is another (less human 
friendly) markup language for creating pdf documents.

- Why I love Markdown:
    + Easy to learn and use.
    + Focus on **content**, rather than **coding** and debugging 
    **errors**.
    + Once you have the basics down, you can get fancy and add HTML,
    JavaScript, and CSS.

## Why should I use markdown?

If you have an annoying process for authoring for the web ...

or

If you avoid authoring for the web, because you're not sure how ...

**start writing in Markdown**!

# R / RStudio

---

## R / RStudio

Rather than use the R graphical user interface we will use RStudio. 
RStudio is a free and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for 
R.

- To access the DSS RStudio server, go to 
    + PhD: http://smith.stat.duke.edu:8787/
    + MS: http://saxon.stat.duke.edu:8787/
    + UG: http://gort.stat.duke.edu:8787/

- Log in with your `netid` and password

---


## Getting started today

In order to get started, you need to obtain the Rmd file from GitHub. The
steps below will give you access to it and everything else we introduce today.

1. Log in to GitHub

2. Navigate to https://github.com/shawnsanto/STT191

3. Fork the repository

4. Copy the link under `Clone or Download` to clone with HTTPS

5. In RStudio go to `File > New Project > Version Control > Git`

6. Paste the URL, that you copied in step 4, in the box under `Repository URL:`

7. Open file `gapminder.Rmd`

You now should have all the files in the repository in a directory on the
server or your own computer.

---

## R packages

- Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include 
reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, 
and sample data.

- In the following exercises we'll use the **tidyverse** package
    + The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.
    + The core tidyverse package consists of **ggplot2**, **tibble**, **tidyr**, **readr**, **purrr**, **dplyr**, **stringr**, and **forcats** packages.
    
- This package is already installed for you on the server, but elsewhere you can 
install it by running the following in the *Console*:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

- You need to load this package with

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

- You only need to install a package once, but you must load it with function
  `library()` each R session.

---

## A note on workspaces

- Your R Markdown document and your Console do not share workspaces

- This is good for reproducibility, but can sometimes result in frustrating 
errors

- This also means any packages needed for your analysis need to be loaded in 
your R Markdown document as well

---

## `gapminder.Rmd`

Read in the data and store it as an object named `gap`.

```{r data-read}
gap <- read_csv("https://bit.ly/gap_data")
```

Function `read_csv()` is part of package `readr`, which is automatically loaded
from package `tidyverse`. Function `read_csv()` not only reads in the data, but
it ensures object `gap` is a neatly formated data frame - known as a tibble.

---

## Examine `gap`

Let's look at the first 10 rows of `gap`.

```{r}
gap %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

---

## Tidy data

## Exercise 1

Take a glimpse at the data set with function `glimpse()`.

```{r glimpse}
glimpse(gap)
```

---

## Exercise 1

How many variables and observations are in `gap`? What are the variable types
for the variables in `gap`?

Variable | Type
---------|----------
country  | character
continent| character
year     | double
lifeExp  | double
pop      | double
gdpPercap| double

---

## Exercise 2

### Part 1

Create a plot of life expectancy versus year for the United States.

```{r usa-code, eval=FALSE}
gap_usa <- gap %>% 
  filter(country == "United States")

ggplot(data = gap_usa, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
  
```

---

## Exercise 2

### Part 1

Create a plot of life expectancy versus year for the United States.

```{r usa-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
gap_usa <- gap %>% 
  filter(country == "United States")

ggplot(data = gap_usa, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
  
```

---

## Exercise 2

### Part 2

Create a plot of life expectancy verses GDP per Capita for Canada. Set the
color of the points to be red and connect them with a solid black line.

```{r canada-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
gap_ca <- gap %>% 
  filter(country == "Canada")

ggplot(data = gap_ca, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  geom_line()
```

---


## Exercise 2

### Part 3

Create a plot of life expectancy versus GDP per Capita based on all countries
in Africa in 1992. Set the color to be purple.

```{r africa-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
gap_africa <- gap %>% 
  filter(continent == "Africa", year == 1992)

ggplot(data = gap_africa, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(color = "purple")
```

---

## Exercise 2

### Part 2

Create a plot of life expectancy verses GDP per Capita for Canada. Set the
color of the points to be red and connect them with a solid black line.

```{r canada-code, eval=FALSE}
gap_ca <- gap %>% 
  filter(country == "Canada")

ggplot(data = gap_ca, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  geom_line()
```

---

## Exercise 2

### Part 3

Create a plot of life expectancy versus GDP per Capita based on all countries
in Africa in 1992. Set the color to be purple.

```{r africa-code, eval=FALSE}
gap_africa <- gap %>% 
  filter(continent == "Africa", year == 1992)

ggplot(data = gap_africa, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(color = "purple")
```

---

## Exercise 3

### Part 1

Create a plot of life expectancy versus GDP per Capita based on all the
countries in Africa and Europe in 1992. Set the point colors to code for the
two continents.

*Hints*:

1. Filter `gap` so it only contains observations from Africa or Europe.
   Do this with `continent %in% c("Africa", "Europe")`. Also, filter so that
   the observations are only from 1992. Separate multiple conditions with
   commas.
   
2. Add another aesthetic to the plot. Instead of just `x` and `y`, include
   `color = continent` inside function `aes()`. The color of the points will
   be set for each level of the variable `continent`.

---

## Exercise 3

### Part 2

Create comparison boxplots by continent of GDP per Capita for the year 2007.
Fill the boxplots in with the color dark green.

*Hints*:

1. Filter `gap` so it only contains observations from 2007.

2. Inside `aes()` set `x = continent, y = gdpPercap`.

3. Use `geom_boxplot()` and set the fill to dark green.

---

## Exercise 3

### Part 1

```{r africa-europe, eval=FALSE}
gap_ae <- gap %>% 
  filter(continent %in% c("Africa", "Europe"), year == 1992)

ggplot(data = gap_ae, mapping = aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap,
                                    color = continent)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Part 2

```{r all-continents, eval=FALSE}
gap_cont <- gap %>% 
  filter(year == 2007)

ggplot(data = gap_cont, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "darkgreen")
```
