## Before we start

To follow along and be active you have a few options.

- Use a docker container from Duke OIT

    1. Go to https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers
    2. Log in with your Duke NetID and password
    3. Find `Jupyter - interactive data science and scientific computing notebooks`
    4. Click the link to create your environment
    
- Get Python and Jupyter notebook for your own computer

    1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
    2. Download Python 3.x version based on your OS
    3. Follow install instructions at https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
    
- Use RStudio (run Python, but no Jupyter notebook)

    1. Log in to DSS RStudio server
    2. In an R Markdown file you can insert Python chunks instead of R chunks
    3. Click the dropdown arrow next to insert

# Jupyter notebook

---

## Overview of the notebook

Bimodal interface: edit mode and command mode

<br>

Click in a cell or hit `enter` to enter edit mode
.center[
![](img/edit-mode.png)
]

When in edit mode you can type code or write text with markdown.

<br>

Hit `esc` to enter command mode
.center[
![](img/command_mode.png)
]

When in command mode you can make edits to the notebook, but not individual
cells.

---

## Notebook shortcuts

In edit mode:

- Run cell and add new cell: `shift + enter`
- Add a line within a cell: `enter`

In command mode:

- Save the notebook: `s`
- Change cell to markdown: `m`
- Change cell to code: `y`
- Cut, copy, paste, delete a cell: `x`, `c`, `v`, `d`
- Add a cell above, below: `a`, `b`

<br><br>

*The point-and-click interface is also an option to execute these commands.*

---

## Jupyter notebook versus R Markdown

- Similar to R Markdown, Jupyter notebooks allow you to write code and text in
one easy to read document that is reproducible and easy to share with others.

- A Jupyter notebook does not knit into an HTML, PDF or Word file. However, you
can embeed HTML into a notebook.

# Basics

---

## Operators

```{python}
10 + 8
3 - 2
100 / 6
80 * 0
100 // 3
```

---

## Operators

```{python}
13 % 4
4 ** 3
```

Operators `&`, `|`, and `^` are bitwise operators. You probably will not need
them. These are used in R, so try not to get confused.

---

## Comparison operators

```{python}
5 > 0
4 < 100
3 == 3
10 <= (5 * 1.9)
0 != 1
```

---


## Comparison operators

Use boolean key words `and`, `or`, and `not` for multiple comparisons.

```{python}
(5 > 10) or (8 / 2 == 4)
True and (8 > 64 ** 0.5)
not True and (8 > 64 ** 0.5)
not (True and (8 > 64 ** 0.5))
```

Parentheses matter. Also, python is case sensitive. True != TRUE unless 
you set a variable TRUE = True which is something you probably shouldn't do.

---

## Differences between Python and R

|      Command     |  Python |        R       |
|:----------------:|:-------:|:--------------:|
|             true |  `True` |  `TRUE` or `T` |
|            false | `False` | `FALSE` or `F` |
|               or |   `or`  |       `|`      |
|              and |  `and`  |       `&`      |
|              not |  `not`  |       `!`      |
|           modulo |   `%`   |      `%%`      |
|   exponentiation |   `**`  |       `^`      |
| integer division |   `//`  |      `%/%`     |

---

## Object assignment

Use a single `=` for object assignment.

```{python}
a = 10
a

b = [-10, 0, "computing", "bootcamp", 5 / 2]
b

my_string = "This is a longgggg string"
my_string

nums = list(range(7))
nums
```

---

## Shortcut operation and assignment

Unlike R, Python supports things like

```{python}
a = 5
a += 3
a
```

```{python}
val = 10
val **= 3
val
```

These are equivalent to `a = a + 3` and `val = val ** 3`, respectively.

# Data structures

---

## Built-in data structures

Python has four built-in data structures

- Lists: an ordered collection of items, mutable
<br><br>
- Tuples: an immutable list
<br><br>
- Dictionaries: an unordered collection of key-value pairs
<br><br>
- Sets: unordered collection of unique objects

---

## Lists

- Lists can contain anything you want.

- The first item in a list is considered to be in position 0, not position 1.

```{python}
my_list2 = [9, [1, 1, 1], 10, "swimming", "hiking"]
my_list2

my_list2[0]
my_list2[1]
my_list2[-1]
```

---

## Tuples

- A tuple looks just like a list, but we use ( ) instead of [ ].

- Remember: tuples are immutable, you won't be able to change individual values

```{python}
cars = ("subaru", "bmw", "hond", "ford")
cars[3]
```

```{python, error=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
# Try to change

cars[2] = "honda"
```

`TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment`

---

## Dictionaries

- Each key is connected to a value.

- The value can be any object you can create in python.

- Syntax: `{"key1": val1, "key2": val2}`

```{python}
my_bike = {"model": "trek", "color": "lime green", "size": 56, "style": "gravel"}

my_bike["model"]

my_bike["year"] = 2019
my_bike
```

---

## Sets

- Test for membership.

- Apply set operators that you know from set theory.

```{python}
my_set = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
my_set

list("seewhathappens")
my_set2 = set(list("aabbbbbbbbcddddddde"))
my_set2
```

# Classes, methods, attributes

---

## A brief introduction to OOP

Python is an object oriented programming (OOP) language. Objects can be
categorized by their class type. For each class there exist methods and
attributes.

- Think of methods as functions defined to be used for only that class.

- Think of attributes as variables defined for use with respect to a class.

- To access methods and attributes: `my_object.<method or attribute>`

---

## Methods in action

```{python}
my_courses = ["STA523", "STA199"]
type(my_courses)
```

```{python}
my_courses.append("STA323")
my_courses
```

```{python}
my_courses.reverse()
my_courses
```

---

## More methods in action

```{python}
x = 4 + 3j
y = 0 + 1J

[x.real, y. real]
[x.imag, y.imag]

```

```{python}
my_string = "python is an object oriented programming language"

my_string.title()
my_string.count("o")
```

---

## Tasks

### Task 1

Create a variable and each of the four built-in data structures (list, tuple,
dictionary, set). For each object use two methods and document in markdown the
functionality of the two methods.

### Task 2

Set `dilemma` to all lowercase. Then, reverse the order of the letters. Lastly,
capitalize the first "b".


```{python}
dilemma = "Borrow OR Rob"
```

*Hint*

`dilemma[start:end:step]`. What does a negative index do?

# Control flow

---

## `if`, `for`, `while`

- The syntax style of control flow in Python is based off `:` and indented
  spaces. Python does not wrap code blocks for control flow with `{ }` as is
  done in R.
- This has plusses and minuses
- There is no `switch` statement and no `repeat` statement

---

## `if`


```{python, eval=FALSE}
if condition:
  # code block
  # indented
elif another_condition:
  # code block
  # indented
else:
  # code block
  # indented

```



```{python}
medical_cost = 180

if medical_cost <= 100:
  bill = medical_cost
elif medical_cost <= 200:
  bill = 100 + (0.5 * (medical_cost - 100))
else:
  bill = 150
  
print("Your total bill is {} dollars.".format(bill))
```

---

## `for` loop


```{python, eval=FALSE}
for index in sequence:
  # code
  # to 
  # be
  # iterated
  # again, indented
```



```{python}
j = 1

for i in "Duke":
  print("Letter {} is {}.\n".format(j, i))
  j += 1
```

---

## `for` loop


```{python, eval=FALSE}
for index in sequence:
  # code
  # to 
  # be
  # iterated
  # again, indented
```


```{python}
j = 1

for i in "Duke":
  print("Letter {} is {}.\n".format(j, i))
  j += 1
```

---

## `for` loop

Some more examples...

```{python}
squares = []
for i in range(1, 11):
  squares.append(i ** 2)
  
squares
```

```{python}
d = {"language": "python", "version": 3.7, 
      "year": 1989, "creator": "Guido van Rossum"}
      
for k, v in d.items():
  print("The key is {}, and its value is {}.".format(k, v))
```

---

## `while` loop


```{python, eval=FALSE}
while condition:
  # code
  # to 
  # be
  # iterated
  # again, indented
```


```{python}
j = 100
i = 1.01
while i < j:
  i *= i
  print(i)

```

---

## `while` loop

Some more examples...

```{python}
nums = list(range(3))
while nums:
  num_off = nums.pop()
  print("The number {} was removed from the list nums.".format(num_off))

```

Python also supports `break` statements

```{python}
my_string = "I'm sleepy, "
i = 1
while True:
  my_string += "z"
  i += 1
  if i > 10:
    break
    
my_string
```

# Functions

---

## Defining a function

As with control flow, Python relies on indentations and `:` for function style
syntax as opposed to `{ }` in R.

.pull-left[
```{python}
def func_name(arg1, arg2):
    """
    Docstring starts wtih a 
    short description.

    May have more 
    information here.

    arg1 = something
    arg2 = somehting

    Returns something

    Example usage:

    func_name(1, 2)
    
    """
    result = arg1 + arg2

    return result
```
]

.pull-right[

```{python}
help(func_name)
```

]

---

## Functions in action

```{python}
def is_prime(n):
  """
  This function checks if a number is prime.
  
  n = positive integer
  
  Example:
  
  is_prime(2)
  is_prime(16)
  
  """
  
  if n < 3:
    result = n - 1
  else:
    for i in range(2, n):
      if (n % i) == 0:
        result = False
        break
    else:
      result = True
      
  return bool(result)
  
```

---

## Function scope

```{python}
x = 10

def f(x):
  print("The value of x on line 1 is: {}".format(x))
  x += x
  print("The value of x on line 3 is: {}".format(x))
  
f(x = x)
  
print("The value of x after the function has run is: {}".format(x))
  
```

---

## Function scope

```{python}
my_list = list("abcd")
print(my_list)

def g(y):
  y.pop()
  print(y)
  print(my_list)
  return y
  
new_list = g(y = my_list)
print(new_list)
```

---

## Tasks

### Task 3

Write a function that takes a list and returns a new list with 
unique elements of the first list.

```{python, echo=FALSE}
def unique_list(lst):
    x = []
    for a in lst:
        if a not in x:
            x.append(a)
    return x
```

```{python}
unique_list([1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5])
```

### Task 4

Use funtion `is_prime()` to write another function that counts how many prime
numbers there are less than or equal to a specified number.

```{python, echo=FALSE}
def prime_count(k):
  count = 0
  for i in range(1, k + 1):
    count += is_prime(i)
  
  return count
```

```{python}
prime_count(k = 1000)
```

---

## Importing

A module is a single importable Python file whereas a package is made up of 
two or more modules. Both can be imported the same way with the keyword
`import`.

For example, `import math` imports the math module and we will get access to
its many functions.

```{python}
import math
math.factorial(5)
math.sqrt(100)
math.log(1)
```


---

## Importing `from`

If you don't want to import all the functions from a module, then you can
just import the ones you need with the keyword `from`.

```{python}
from math import factorial, sqrt, log
factorial(5)
sqrt(100)
log(1)
```

We no longer have to preface each function call with `math.`. You can
import all functions from a given module with

```{python, eval=FALSE}
from math import *
```

However, this is a bad idea as you may have conflicts between your 
object names and function names in the module.

---

## Importing `as`

For brevity, people often give an alias to a package or module on import. This
can be done with the keyword `as`.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Rather than type `matplotlib.pyplot.hist()` a user can type `plt.hist()`. 
There are common conventions for aliases so stick to using those.

---

## Example

Import packages / modules:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

In Jupyter notebook you'll want to include the below line of code in a cell
to allow for inline plotting.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
%matplotlib inline
```

```{python, eval=FALSE}
data = np.random.rand(20, 20)
plt.imshow(data)
plt.colorbar()
```

---

## Example

```{python, eval=FALSE}
norm_rv = st.norm.rvs(loc = 0,scale = 1, size = 5000)
plt.hist(x=norm_rv, bins=20, alpha=.5, color="purple",
          edgecolor='black', linewidth=1.2)
```

---

## Tasks

### Task 5

Create a histogram based off of random variables generated from a probability
distribution of your choice.

### Task 6

Plot 100 time steps of a simple symmetric random walk that starts at the value
0.

```{python, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
moves = np.random.random(100)
moves[moves < 0.5] = -1
moves[moves >= 0.5] = 1
walk = moves.cumsum()
walk_list = list(walk)
walk_list.insert(0, 0)
plt.plot(walk_list)
plt.show()
```
